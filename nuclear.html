                India's nuclear program represents one of the nation's most significant scientific and strategic achievements. From conducting peaceful nuclear explosions to developing advanced reactors and the unique three-stage thorium program, India has built a self-reliant nuclear capability despite facing international sanctions and technology denial regimes.
            </p>

            <h2>The Vision of Homi J. Bhabha</h2>
            
            <p>
                The foundation of India's nuclear program was laid by Dr. Homi J. Bhabha, often called the "Father of the Indian Nuclear Program." In 1944, he established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), which became the nucleus of India's nuclear research efforts. His vision was two-fold:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Harness nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development</li>
                <li>Maintain strategic autonomy through self-reliance in nuclear technology</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Peaceful Nuclear Explosion: Operation Smiling Buddha (1974)</h2>

            <p>
                On May 18, 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test, codenamed "Smiling Buddha," at Pokhran in Rajasthan. Led by Raja Ramanna, this test made India the sixth nation to demonstrate nuclear capability. Key aspects included:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The device was called a "Peaceful Nuclear Explosive" (PNE)</li>
                <li>Yield was approximately 8-12 kilotons</li>
                <li>Demonstrated India's indigenous nuclear technology capability</li>
                <li>Used plutonium from the CIRUS reactor</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The test led to international sanctions and formation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which aimed to prevent nuclear proliferation. However, it also established India as a significant nuclear power.
            </p>

            <h2>Operation Shakti: The 1998 Tests</h2>

            <p>
                On May 11 and 13, 1998, India conducted a series of five nuclear tests at Pokhran, known as Operation Shakti or Pokhran-II. Under the leadership of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and Dr. R. Chidambaram, these tests included:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fission devices:</strong> Including a thermonuclear device</li>
                <li><strong>Boosted fission devices:</strong> Enhanced yield weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Sub-kiloton devices:</strong> Tactical nuclear weapons</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The tests demonstrated India's advanced nuclear weapons capability and led to India declaring itself a nuclear weapons state. While initially resulting in international sanctions, India's strategic position eventually led to the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2008.
            </p>

            <h2>The Three-Stage Nuclear Power Program</h2>

            <p>
                Dr. Bhabha envisioned a unique three-stage nuclear power program to achieve energy independence, leveraging India's limited uranium but abundant thorium reserves:
            </p>

            <h3>Stage 1: Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs)</h3>
            <p>
                The first stage uses natural uranium in heavy water reactors. India has successfully built and operates several 220 MWe, 540 MWe, and 700 MWe PHWRs. These reactors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use natural uranium (no enrichment needed)</li>
                <li>Produce plutonium-239 as a byproduct</li>
                <li>Generate electricity while creating fuel for Stage 2</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stage 2: Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs)</h3>
            <p>
                Fast breeder reactors use plutonium-239 from Stage 1 and produce more fissile material than they consume. Key developments include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FBTR:</strong> Fast Breeder Test Reactor at Kalpakkam (operational since 1985)</li>
                <li><strong>PFBR:</strong> Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (500 MWe) - India's first commercial FBR</li>
                <li>FBRs convert uranium-238 into plutonium-239 and thorium-232 into uranium-233</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stage 3: Thorium-Based Reactors</h3>
            <p>
                The ultimate goal is thorium-based reactors using uranium-233 from Stage 2. India has:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>World's largest thorium reserves (estimated 25% of global reserves)</li>
                <li>Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) design completed</li>
                <li>Research on thorium fuel cycles at BARC and other facilities</li>
                <li>Plans for commercial thorium reactors by 2040s</li>
